Text: A retrospective of Sasaki’s artistic output, the design of this monograph interprets thematic angles present in much of the artist’s work. The worn foil stamping on the cover speaks to the concept of the publication and its title, Good Intentions; what should be pristine is instead worn down, and references the artist’s explorations of eternal optimism, ambition, cynicism, futility, tragedy, and the trappings of failure. Typographical choices and the use of black throughout the layout touch on the inspiration the artist occasionally takes from old silent films.
